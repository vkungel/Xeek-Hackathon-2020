Challenge Details
Data: bit.ly/minesdata

Office Hours Sign-up: https://calendly.com/mineschallenge/office-hours

Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last several years academia and industry have built several deep learning fault prediction models for seismic volumes. These models are a boon for geoscientists as interpreting all of the faults in a seismic volume is an arduous task that is rarely completed. 

However, these models are not a complete solution as the output from them is a fault probability volume, not fault planes which are the unit of interest for geoscientists.  Fault planes are used to understand tectonic stress regimes, reconstruct formations, and define trapping elements for hydrocarbon prospects. Until fault planes can be produced, these prediction algorithms will only remain partially useful.

The goal of this challenge is to generate fault planes from a fault probability volume and then analyze them to help geoscientists better synthesize the structural components in the data.

 

Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge data can be found at bit.ly/minesdata.

Included in the above package is:

·  Synthetic seismic volume and fault probability volume (NumPy format)

·  Real data (Australia) seismic volume and fault probability volume (NumPy format)

·  Geobodies of faults

Expected Output
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contestants will be given a list of tasks to be completed for the challenge each with their own difficult rating and points for successful completed.  Contestants can choose to do as many or as few tasks as their interest and skills allow.

Contestants are required to submit the outputs above as well as a Jupityr notebook that will be run against another fault probability volume. Notebooks should contain thorough and complete documentation.

Python submissions are preferred. If you would like to use a different language, please contact the Xeek team at mineschallenge@xstarter.xyz.

Contestants will be allowed one submission during the Challenge period.  Submissions should be emailed to mineschallenge@xstarter.xyz.

Evaluation Criteria
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A panel of three judges will judge each submission on completeness, creativity, and potential to scale.

Each completed task will be given a score of either 1 (completed), 0.6 (partial completion), or 0.3 (earnest start).  These scores will be multiplied by the scoring multiple for the task to give an overall score for the task.  Scores from all completed tasks will be summed for the final score.

In the case of a tie, the three judges will determine which of the tied teams had the most impressive submission and will consider the following criteria: 1) is an output created?, 2) Does the code describe the contestant's line of thinking in markdown, including future steps if not completed?, and 3) Simplicity and run time of code submitted.

 

Timeline
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Challenge will kick off at our launch event on campus on January 24th at 12:01PM MST and will conclude on February 14th at 2:00PM MST.

Registration will remain open until January 31st at 5:00PM MST.

 

Prizes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st Place: $6,000

2nd Place: $3,000

3rd Place: $1,000

 

 

Challenge Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One registration per participant

You cannot join the challenge using multiple email addresses. Participants found to be using multiple email addresses will be disqualified.

 

Team Limits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The maximum team size is 4.

When you register, you must provide email addresses for each of your team members.  If you wish to add team members after registering please contact support@xstarter.xyz. Teams can be modified until January 31st at 5:00PM MST.

If a team wins a Prize, the Prize will be split evenly among team members, unless the Team unanimously agrees to a different Prize split.  Prizes will only be split if all team member emails were provided at competition start. 

All taxes imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winner. Prizes will be net of any taxes the Competition Sponsor is required to withhold.  If a winner fails to provide any required documentation the prize will be forfeited.

 

Winners Obligations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prize winners must agree to the following obligations in order to receive a prize:

1.     Deliver the model used to generate the winning Submission and follow the documentation guidelines that will be provided by Xeek.  The model will be verified to ensure it produces the expected results. The model must be accompanied by a description or resources required to build and run the code successfully.

2.     Sign and return prize acceptance documents that are required including: eligibility certification, licenses, releases, U.S tax forms, and any other required documents.

3.     Agree to the Intellectual Property rules documented below

4.     Agree to a one-hour phone call with the XEEK team and affiliates to discuss the winning solution and the learnings from participating in the Competition.

 

Data Access
